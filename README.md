# text-classification-and-ml-model-interpretation-with-eli5sklearn-and-spacy-
In this project I classify text/document using machine learning and then move on to interpret our classification model with Eli5.  This is the workflow we will be using in this project.  Text Preprocessing We will be using spacy and basic python to preprocess our documents to get a clean dataset We will remove all stop words and build a tokenizer and a couple of lemmas. This is to help improve our dataset which we will feed into our model.    Text Classification and Model Building Since we are working with text document we will be using countvectorizer or TFID to help in our vectorization Vectorization here means we are converting our text into numbers so that our ML will be able to understand it. We will then build our model using algorithms from scikitlearn package You can choose any algorithm as you like.    Prediction We will then use our trained model to do some predictions We calculate the accuracy of our model    Interpretation of Our Machine Learning Model The next step involves using Eli5 to help interpret and explain why our ML model gave us such a prediction We will then check for how trustworthy our interpretation is with Eli5â€™s metrics
